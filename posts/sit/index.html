Did you cheat?</p><p><em>Sit.</em> is a brutally simple alarm clock, not much more complex than an egg timer. You choose a length of time to just sit in silence, set it and forget it. When that time is up, a gong gently brings you back and then repeats every minute until you switch it off – so you don’t lose track of time.</p><p>Some people (myself included) use it to meditate, but there really is no right way of enjoying it.</p><p>To be fair, “just sit” is also a famous zen koan. But regardless of the reason, as long as I can get you to sit down on your ass for a moment and stop trying to be productive, I’m a happy man.</p><blockquote><p>Sidenote: why do we say “brutally” simple and not, say, “elegantly” simple? The selection process of building things like this app could be considered “brutal”, but we don’t call poetry or mathematics “brutal” where both areas are essentially an art form based on seeking simplicity.<br>We don’t really say, “Did you read that haiku? Was it brutal?”, do we?</p></blockquote><p>I’ve always loved the idea of simple, atomic (as “<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/atomic#etymonline_v_26676">indivisible</a>”) tools, objects with a brütally™ simple purpose. They’re easy to explain, you can stack them like legos and compose. <em>Sit.</em> is an exercise in that.</p><p>Some of my other projects, like <a href="https://enso.sonnet.io/">Ensō</a>, <a href="http://facade.photo/">Façade</a>, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/rafalpast/status/1272945933228167169?s=20">goat telling me to slow down when I talk too fast</a>, also follow the same principle. So let’s focus on the specifics: why are we talking about <em>Sit.</em>, and not, say, <em>Squanch</em>?</p><h2>Reason #1: Time</h2><blockquote><p>&quot;Live Slow, Die Old&quot;<br><cite>an ancient Doom Metal koan</cite></p></blockquote><p>In the past decade the Web has become a sort of a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/03/tv-politics-entertainment-metaverse/672773/">shitty metaverse</a>. Every step you take is watched and assessed in terms of its monetisation potential, every interaction is meant to extract value from you. Fine, IndieWeb and Mastodon are making things marginally better, but there’s so much more to be done outside of their little bubbles (which I love dearly).</p><figure class="post__figure"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/opt/lItwS-YeNB-600.avif 600w, /images/opt/lItwS-YeNB-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/opt/lItwS-YeNB-600.webp 600w, /images/opt/lItwS-YeNB-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/images/opt/lItwS-YeNB-600.jpeg 600w, /images/opt/lItwS-YeNB-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><img alt="A messy hand-drawn illustration with a variety of characters screaming at each other using cheesy social media hashtags or conspiracy theory quotes (e.g. &quot;peppa the pig did a nazi salute!&quot;, &quot;#blessed&quot;, &quot;I have no mouth but I must scream&quot;)." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../images/opt/lItwS-YeNB-600.jpeg" width="1200" height="861"></picture><figcaption>An artist's interpretation of my Twitter feed, the colours depicted are not accurate.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like advertising, which assumes consent by default, most of the Web in its current shape robs you of your time.

Spoiler: you were looking for something else, but got lost on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>A funny thing can happen when you use <em>Sit.</em> When you just sit and do nothing, every minute drags on into what feels like infinity. But when you mindlessly watch TikTok or doomscroll through Twitter on the other hand, hyperspace seems to bend in the opposite direction: I blink and the pasta is overcooked, I blink again and the light in the kitchen is different, cooler, the shadows have moved. Are we really alive if we’re not here?</p><p>When you open <em>Sit.</em>, I don’t try to fill your brain with anything. It’s just you and your thoughts. That can get uncomfortable. But when you finish, for some strange reason you feel better.</p><blockquote><p>Alternative title for reason #1: the time I want back.</p></blockquote><p>The two other reasons I built <em>Sit.</em> are more trivial and less likely to generate a rant.</p><h2>Reason #2: Motivation</h2><p>I’ve decided to drop full time work and move back to personal projects, which means I’m still figuring out a structure for my day, which means it’s easy to get stuck in a rut.</p><p>You see, I suffer from a condition known as <em>irony deficiency</em>: even though I preach simplicity when mentoring or running workshops, I struggle with the very same thing in my own practice. Speak with your GP if these symptoms seem familiar.</p><p>After a few days of running around in circles, I decided to take a detour and build something else to boost my morale a bit, <em>ideally something so small I couldn’t afford not to finish and share it</em> (hold that thought, we’ll get back to it in the second post).</p><p>The most prolific and creative people I know get their boost of motivation from projects with a short feedback loop. This way they can have contact with the user, and watch as their work is enjoyed by others or at the very least interacted with. Building things for others is a form of communication, and it fulfils a very basic human need.</p><p>Iterative methodologies like Agile are not only useful because they allow us to split problems into smaller, more testable chunks, bringing us closer to the essence of a problem. There’s also a mental health and motivation aspect to it which honestly deserves its own article.</p><blockquote><p>Alternative title for reason #2:<br>I’m stuck, pass the shovel, not this one, the small one.</p></blockquote><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-600.avif 600w, /images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-600.webp 600w, /images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-600.jpeg 600w, /images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><img alt="A simple border made of a bunch of tiny shovels in a row, forming a horizontal line. One of the shovels is gold." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="../../images/opt/uzyhpBskOb-600.jpeg" width="1200" height="152"></picture></p><h2>Reason #3: Black dog</h2><p>The final reason will sound trivial, but it’s one of those trivial things worth repeating till they’ve finally carved into our brains: mental health is important.</p><p>I’m interested in mental health both from a professional and personal point of view. I’m not a therapist or a qualified medical professional, so I try to help using the skills I have. The areas where I can contribute somewhat usefully took the form of my work on privacy, using music and psychedelics for therapeutic purposes at <a href="https://wavepaths.com/">Wavepaths</a>, and writing tools supporting mental health in my spare time. The beauty of building those (digital) tools for myself is that it costs 0$ to share them with others.</p><blockquote><p>Rant: It just feels perplexing how preoccupied we are with sending people to a dead rock 138600000 km away by treating some random tech bro like your favourite football team, where at the same time we have 1000s of Curies, Teslas, Newtons worth of human potential, brain power which could be unlocked with sometimes relatively little work. Those people are not 1 au away. Yet, we fetishise those who make us miserable instead.</p></blockquote><p>There’s so much low hanging fruit here.</p><h3>Reason #3.1: I have <em>very specific</em> clock needs.</h3><p>I don’t want to be wise. I want to be clockwise.</p><p><em>But seriously</em> now. Another big reason why <em>Sit.</em> is built this way is habit reinforcement. Preventing issues is easier than crisis management once the black dog pays a visit.</p><p>I try to meditate every day in the morning. For me it’s a form of mental hygiene and a “spiritual” practice only in terms of connecting with something bigger than us (nature, not religion). One of the types of meditation I practise, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samatha-vipassana">shi-nè</a>, is quite challenging because it involves learning how to detach yourself from the voice in your head <em>without</em> focusing on anything else in particular like breath or music.</p><figure class="post__figure"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-600.avif 600w, /images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-600.webp 600w, /images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-600.jpeg 600w, /images/opt/SkHXiTsaL_-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><img alt="A red ballon with a face peeking out of a hole in the ground, looking up longingly towards a bunch of tiny people, dressed as if they were going to work, holding suitcases.

Our brain constantly looks for things to focus on, it abhors a vacuum. So the positive effects of this exercise take time to manifest. And maintaining a habit that initially feels <em>unpleasant</em> is hard.</p><p>Remember earlier when I said that although sitting down and doing nothing can be unpleasant at first, when you finish for some strange reason you feel better? It turns out, you benefit from habits more if you take some time to reflect on them after you’re done. It also makes them easier to stick, by teaching us to associate reward with an initially annoying activity.</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-600.avif 600w, /images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-600.webp 600w, /images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-600.jpeg 600w, /images/opt/IIAxg4hwsO-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><img alt="A red ballon with a face peeking out of a hole in the ground, looking up longingly towards a little black hole in the ceiling.

It lets me wind down and reflect without aggressively throwing me back into my regular routine like an alarm clock would. And it gives me more control over my meditation schedule: I still know how much time has passed but I can afford to spend another minute or two on it .</p><blockquote><p>Alternative title for reason #3: The fact that I keep snoozing is not a bug, it’s a feature!</p></blockquote><h2>Closing words (for now)</h2><p>How did it go?</p><p><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/images/opt/UBlL9OMu76-600.avif 600w, /images/opt/UBlL9OMu76-1200.avif 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/images/opt/UBlL9OMu76-600.webp 600w, /images/opt/UBlL9OMu76-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="/images/opt/UBlL9OMu76-600.jpeg 600w, /images/opt/UBlL9OMu76-1200.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 60rem, 100vw"><img alt="Screenshots of feedback and testimonials given by the users of Sit.
